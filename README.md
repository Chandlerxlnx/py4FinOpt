## Viewing Jupyter Notebooks

If you would like to view but not run the notebooks, I recommend the nbviewer hosted by Jupyter. While GitHub has their own, not all Latex seems to render correctly (see [nbviewer Issue #452](https://github.com/jupyter/nbviewer/issues/452)). 

To use Jupyter's, go to [http://nbviewer.jupyter.org](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org) and paste in the URL pointing to the ipynb file. 

## Installing Dependencies

```{r, engine='bash'}
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
